* Authors found "no related work that emphasizes the use of AI concept and
  state-of-the art technologies for cognitive robotics *education*"
* **Personal opinion:** if you remove the *education* restriction from your
  search, you find plenty of software systems, some of even which have been
  used in education
* **Example, here at CSM:** Tom Williams uses the ADE system in his L-HRI
